# Variables in python

## Introduction

To store `value`s for the further use
in our code, we use `variable`s.

In this tutorial, you will learn how to
define a `variable` and different
types of `variable`s that we have in `python`.

## Define a variable

To define a `variable` in `python`, we can
simply put the `value` that we want in a `variable`
that we want using a simple `=`. for example:

```python
x = 2
```

But there are some rules on defining a variable in
python, the name of a `variable`:

1. should start with a letter or an underscore `_`.
2. can't start with a number.
3. should only have:
    * alphabetic characters (either lower case or upper case): `a-z`, `A-Z`
    * numbers: `0-9`
    * underscore: `_`
4. it is recommended to start a variable name with
   lower case character `a-z`.

| valid | not valid |
|:-----:|:---------:|
|   x   |     7     |
|  x5   |    5x     |
|  _x   |    -x     |
|   X   |           |
|  x_y  |    x-y    |

## Different types of variables

We have different types of `variable`s in python.
In the table below, there are some types with
an example of it.

|    type    |     example     |
|:----------:|:---------------:|
|    int     |       `2`       |
|   float    |      `2.1`      |
|  complex   |      `2j`       |
|   string   |   `'example'`   |
|    list    |   `[1, 2, 3]`   |
|   tuple    |   `(1, 2, 3)`   |
| dictionary |  `{1:2, 3:4}`   |
|  boolean   | `True`, `False` |
|    set     |   `{1, 2, 3}`   |
|    none    |     `None`      |
